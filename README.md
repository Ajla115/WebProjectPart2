# CarRentalSystem-WebProgrammingProject2023
-> This is a second repository for a second part of the project "Car Rental System"  from the course "Introduction to Web Programming" in academic year 2022/23. 
-> In this repository we have finished frontend, ajax requests, JWT tokens, swagger, middleware, working email and spapp. Fully functional signup and login forms were implemented.
->For the first part of the project, regarding backend, please follow this link: https://github.com/Ajla115/CarRentalSystem-WebProgrammingProject2023
-> At the moment the database is deployed, however if by the moment you're seeing this, the database is no longer deployed, there is an sql file attached to this project, so you can run it yourself and set up your database credentials, and deploy locally.
